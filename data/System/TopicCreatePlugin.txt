---+!! Topic Create Plugin 

This Plugin allows you to automatically create topics or attach files at topic save time. This is typically used by Foswiki applications to create a set of template based topics.

%TOC%

---++ <nop>TOPICCREATE - Automatically Create a Set of Foswiki Topics

	* The =%<nop>TOPICCREATE{}%= Macro is useful for creating topics based on templates
	* Example scenario: You have a notebook application where users can create new notebooks based on a notebook template topic. Each time a user creates a new notebook you would like to create a set of child topics, each based on a separate template.
	* Syntax: =%<nop>TOPICCREATE{ &lt;attributes&gt; }%=
	* Attributes recognized
	  | *Attribute* | *Meaning* | *Valid input* | *Default* |
	  | =template=""= | Name of Foswiki topic to be used as template | Any valid Foswiki topic | (required) |
	  | =topic=""= | Name of new Foswiki topic to create | Any valid <nop>WikiWord | (required) |
	  | =disable=""= | Name of the template topic containing this use of TOPICCREATE | Any valid topic name (<nop>WikiWord) | _recommended_ |
	  | =parameters=""= | List of parameters to pass to a child topic to initialize any urlparams.| Following syntax:%BR% =&lt;parameter-name&gt;=&lt;parameter-value&gt;= followed by any number of parameter name, value pairs separated by =&= | No Parameters |
	* The action to create the Foswiki topic will not occur until one hits the =Save Changes= button in preview
	* The =%<nop>TOPICCREATE{}%= variable will be removed upon saving of the topic
	* Any attachments that are in the =template= will also be copied to the new topic
	* =%<nop>TOPICCREATE%= is recursive
	* Write =%<nop>TOPICCREATE{ template="<nop>MyTemplate" topic="<nop>%<nop>TOPIC%MyNewTopicName" parameters="MyParameterName=MyParameterValue&Hello=Goodbye" }%= to create a foswiki topic based on another topic =<nop>MyTemplate= with the name =<nop>%<nop>TOPIC%MyNewTopicName=. Any =%<nop>URLPARAM{}%=  with the name =MyParameterName= and =Hello= present in =MyTemplate= will be replaced with =MyParameterValue= and =Goodbye=.
	* To prevent the action from happening in your template topic you should either include the =disable= argument, or escape it: =%<nop>TOPICCRE%<nop>NOP%ATE{...}%=. The =%<nop>NOP%= gets removed when a topic gets instantiated based on a template.

---++ <nop>TOPICATTACH - Automatically Copy Attachments to a Topic 

	* Example scenario: You have a template topic and would like to attach a file whose content or name is determined by URL parameters at topic creation time.  This is usually done for a topic that was just created via TOPICCREATE as described above.
	* Syntax: =%<nop>TOPICATTACH{ &lt;attributes&gt; }%=
	* Attributes recognized
	  | *Attribute* | *Meaning* | *Valid input* | *Default* |
	  | =fromtopic=""= | Topic (or Web.Topic) that contains the attachment  | Any valid Foswiki topic | (required) |
	  | =fromfile=""= | The attachment to copy from | Any attached file from =fromtopic= | (required) |
	  | =disable=""= | Name of the template topic containing this use of TOPICATTACH | Any valid topic name (<nop>WikiWord) | (required) |
	  | =comment=""= | Comment to appear for the attachment within this topic, replacing the comment that was in the =fromtopic= | a one line string | {omit parameter if no change desired} |
	* Write =%<nop>TOPICATTACH{ fromtopic="<nop>SourceTopic" fromfile="Sample.jpg" name="Snoopy.jpg" disable="..."}%= to attach =Sample.jpg= from topic =<nop>SourceTopic= as =Snoopy.jpg=
	* The parameter value comment is used to change the comment (description) that shows for the topic in the table of attachments
	* The "hidden" attribute of the topic is removed: the attachment can be hidden in the =fromtopic= if desired
	* The =fromtopic= can specify a different web if desired.  For example =Foswiki<nop>.Some<nop>Template= would be valid as a =fromtopic=
	* To prevent the action from happening in your template topic you *must* provide the =disable= parameter with the topic name containing the =%<nop>TOPICATTACH%=.

---++ Limitations/TODO
   * The =TOPICATTACH= must be in the 'top level' topic being saved by a =TOPICCREATE=.  It can not be in a recursive/subordinate topic invoked by the TOPICCREATE
   * There is a half-baked =%<nop>TOPICPATCH%= implementation from this plugins TWiki days which requires completing, testing and documenting. You are more than welcome to implement this if you would find it useful.

---++ Plugin Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>TOPICCREATEPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==

	* One line description, is shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Automatically create a set of topics and attachments at topic save time

	* Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
		* Set DEBUG = 0
